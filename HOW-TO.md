the exercises are all plain JS files, you can study them one at a time in Node or the browser


to review the code in any directory, navigate to that directory and execute `node review.js`.

all sub-folders will be evaluated. new readmes and report.json's will also be generated.

if you are in a sub-directory, you will just need to adjust the path. ie `node ../review.js`
